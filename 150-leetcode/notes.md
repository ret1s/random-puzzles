# LEETCODE 150 NOTES
### 15/11/2023
Today, I practiced problems that use two pointers technique approach.
Here are some notes:
* When we meet a problem that requires finding indexes of two elements in a given array so that the sum of them is equal to a given target. In case the given array is unsorted, using hash map data structure is a good approach. On the other side, when the given array is sorted, using two pointers will be a better approach.
